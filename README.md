# bot_lundi
This is a Discord bot that says "It's monday" when you ping a specific role on Mondays.
It's been upgraded to also say something on Tuesdays.


About the .gitignore file :
I'm ignoring the Powershell scripts and batch files because they contain some information I don't feel like sharing. Besides, we're only focusing on the Python bot, nothing else.

I'm also ignoring a file called secret_values, which will contain the token of MY bot, along with the ID of the Discord roles.
This means you must create this file yourself, and add the values yourself.

Lastly, the seto file is just a .webp image of Seto Kaiba, but feel free to add whtaver you'd like.
